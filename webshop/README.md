## Introduction
Here in this repo, we contain the minimum code from WebShop for our BOLAA implementation.

## Installation
1. Follow the [original setup](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WebShop/tree/master#-setup) to create the webshop environment.
2. Run `./run_dev.sh` or you can follow the original setup to run a **web server** in the background process.
